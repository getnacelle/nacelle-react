# `nacelle-react`

Nacelle is a managed backend service that acts as the connective tissue for headless commerce. Our infrastructure is built on an event-driven elastic core that Nacelle fully manages, so you don't have to worry about scaling, updates, and general DevOps. We focus on fighting headless headaches like eventual consistency, backend maintenance, and interoperability so you can build the things that matter to your brand without getting bogged down.

This repository contains packages and examples you can use to build your Nacelle-powered storefront with React.js.

## Packages

All `nacelle-react` [**packages**](https://github.com/getnacelle/nacelle-react/tree/main/packages) are published to npm. Please refer to a package's README for installation instructions.

## Examples

[**Examples**](https://github.com/getnacelle/nacelle-react/tree/main/examples) demonstrate React project setups with a particular metaframework or third-party integration.

To scaffold a frontend example project, we recommend using [`degit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/degit):

```
npx degit https://github.com/getnacelle/nacelle-react/examples/<example-project-name> my-new-project
```

Using `degit` for project scaffolding allows you to create a fresh project without needing to clone the `nacelle-react` monorepo.
