This package is deprecated. Instead, we encourage merchant developers to create their own UI components for email capture. When a user submits their email address, the address should be sent to a serverless function which leverages [Klaviyo's API](https://apidocs.klaviyo.com/reference) to add users to a Klaviyo list.
